description: "Description of the Cypher Subset supported by TuringDB and the different queries built in TuringDB"
---

TuringDB supports a subset of the **Cypher query language**, extended with versioning, metadata introspection, and flexible property matching.

This guide covers the supported syntax and features, including `MATCH`, `CREATE`, property filters, node ID injection, metaqueries, and available data types.

<Note>
   In our autumn 2025 release we will be supporting nearly 100% of Cypher. 
</Note>

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Basics

Queries are built by referencing nodes and edges. TuringDB supports the standard CYPHER syntax, in that nodes are denoted using parentheses `()`, whilst edges are denoted using square brackets `[]`.

For example, `(n)`  would denote a node named `n`, whilst `[e]` would denote an edge named `e`.

Nodes and edges can have both **label** and **property** constraints. As in standard CYPHER, property constraints are specified using curly brackets `{}`, whilst labels are specified using colon `:` syntax.

An example of a node with a label constraint would be `(n:Person)`.

An example of an edge with a property constraint would be `[e{duration=10}]`.

Property and label constraints may be combined, for instance, `(n:Person{name="John"})` specifies a node which both has the label `Person`, and a `name` property with the value `John`.

Nodes and edges can have label and property multiple constraints, which are specified in a comma-separated list: `(n:Person,Man{name=‚ÄùJohn‚Äù, age=20})`. These lists can be arbitrarily long.

### Summary:

Queries are built around **nodes** and **edges**:

- **Nodes** are written in parentheses `()`
  e.g. `(n)` - a node with alias `n`
- **Edges** are written in square brackets `[]`
  e.g. `[e]` - an edge with alias `e`

You can add:

- **Labels** with a colon `:` - e.g. `(n:Person)`
- **Property constraints** with curly braces `{}` - e.g. `[e{duration=10}]`
- **Both** at once - e.g. `(n:Person{name="John"})`

Multiple labels and properties can be specified:

```sql
(n:Person,Man{name="John", age=20})
```

# üîç¬†Queries

Queries are built up of combinations of nodes and edges, as specified above.

TuringDB supports two main query operations: `MATCH` and `CREATE`.

## `MATCH` queries

`MATCH` queries are used to retrieve nodes, edges, and their property values from the database via specification of relationships and properties.

It is easiest to demonstrate the syntax of a `MATCH` query with a concrete example:

```jsx
MATCH (n)-[e]-(m) RETURN n 
```

The above query will look for nodes in the database which have at least one edge to a different node. The query will return the internal ID of the node `n`.

<Tip>
  When using `RETURN n`, other implementations of CYPHER may return all properties of `n`, whilst TuringDB only returns the internal ID of `n`.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Specifying the direction of edges (e.g. `<-[e]-`) is not currently supported in TuringDB. All edges are implicitly directed from left-to-right.
</Warning>

`MATCH` queries are flexible: they can contain a single node and no edges, or any number of node, edge pairs. For example:

```jsx
MATCH (n) RETURN n
```

will match all nodes in the database. An example of a multi-hop `MATCH` query would be:

```jsx
MATCH (n)-[e]-(m)-[f]-(p) RETURN p
```

<Card title horizontal>
  Queries have _variables_, which in the above examples are those such as `n`, `m`, `e`, etc. Variables are a way to give a name to a node or an edge, so that those nodes or edges can be specified in the `RETURN` clause. However, if you do not want to return an edge or its properties, the edge need not have a name. For example:

  ```jsx
  MATCH (n)--(m) RETURN m
  ```

  Both node and edges can omit a variable name if they specify at least a label constraint:

  ```jsx
  MATCH (:Person)-[:FriendsWith]-(m) RETURN m
  ```
</Card>

You can also return multiple properties using a comma separated list:

```jsx
MATCH (n:Person)--(m:Person) RETURN n.name, m.age
```

Combining the syntax of `MATCH` queries, and the ability to specify constraints, here are a few examples of some syntactically correct TuringDB `MATCH` queries:

- `MATCH (n:Person) return n.name`
- `MATCH (:Person)‚Äî(n:Person) return n.age`
- `MATCH (n:Person,Woman,SoftwareEngineer)‚Äî(m)-[e]-(p:Man)-[f]-(q) return e,f`

<Warning>
  Note that whilst all the above the queries are all _syntactically_ valid, if the graph does not have a node property which is used in a query, it will fail to execute.
</Warning>

<Card title horizontal>
  `RETURN` clauses also support the `*` operator, as such:

  ```jsx
  MATCH (n:Person)-[e]-(m) RETURN *
  ```

  which is equivalent to:

  ```jsx
  MATCH (n:Person)-[e]-(m) RETURN n, e, m
  ```

  That is, `RETURN *` is equivalent to returning _all entities_ in the `MATCH` query.
</Card>

## `CREATE` queries

`CREATE` queries follow exactly the same syntax as `MATCH` queries when it comes to specifying nodes, edges, and property/label constraints, but they do not have `RETURN` clauses. There is also the additional requirement that all nodes and edges _must have at least one label_. This means a query such as

```jsx
CREATE (n)
```

is not valid, whilst

```jsx
CREATE (n:Person)
```

is a valid query.

Because `CREATE` queries have no `RETURN` clause, there is no requirement to declare any names for any variables. This means we can have queries such as

```sql
CREATE (:Person)-[:FriendsWith]-(:Person)
```

However, naming variables can be useful if you want to create multiple edges to or from a given node. For instance, if you would like to create a triangle pattern, this can be achieved using the following approach

```sql
CREATE (a:Corner)-[:Edge]-(b:Corner), (b)-[:Edge]-(c:Corner), (c)-[:Edge]-(a)
```

<Info>
  This can also be achieved over multiple `CREATE` queries using Node ID injection.
</Info>

# üßæData Types

TuringDB offers the following data types for node and edge properties:

- String
- Boolean
- Integer (signed)
- Unsigned integer
- Double (decimal)

By default, if you create a property with a whole-number numeric value, it will be stored in the database engine as a signed integer. If you would like to explicitly use an unsigned value, you can use the `u` suffix after the numeric value in your create query:

```sql
CREATE (n:Person{age=20u, name="Jane"})
```

`MATCH` queries provide an automatic coercion from integer to unsigned integer, so if the above `CREATE` query is submitted, and you run

```jsx
MATCH (n{age=20}) return n.name
```

and it will match the node created above, returning

```arduino
+------+
| Jane |
|------|
|  ... |
+------+
```

However, the opposite coercion is not supported: if you use the `u` suffix in a `MATCH` query, the query will attempt to match an unsigned integer property.

<Warning>
  If you query a property with a type which does not match the type of the property stored in the database, the query will not execute (aside from the coercion described above).
</Warning>

String properties can be enclosed using double quotes (`"`), single quotes (`'`), or backticks (\`\`\`).

# üß©¬†Operators

TuringDB allows you to query against node and edge properties using the `:` or `=` operators, which both operate in exactly the same way: exact matching of the property value. This means both the following queries are equivalent:

```jsx
MATCH (n{name="Matt", age:20, hasPhD=false}) RETURN n
MATCH (n{name:"Matt", age=20, hasPhD:false}) RETURN n
```

Additionally, TuringDB supports the approximate string operator, `~=`, which is explained here.

# üîê¬†Node ID Injection

It is possible to reference existing nodes in the database using their internal ID.

<Info>
  The internal ID of a node, `n`, is the value returned by the query `MATCH (n) return n`.
</Info>

Node ID injection can be performed using the `@` operator or the `AT` keyword. The basic syntax is flexible, as

```jsx
MATCH (n @ 1) RETURN n.name
MATCH (n:Person @ 1) RETURN n.name
MATCH (n:Person{name="Jane"} @ 1) RETURN n.name
MATCH (n:Person @ 1 {name="Jane}) RETURN n.name
MATCH (n @ 1 {name="Jane}) RETURN n.name
MATCH (n {name="Jane} @ 1) RETURN n.name
```

are all valid uses of the `@` operator to perform injection by node ID. Further, replacing `@` with `AT` is equally valid in all the above cases.

It is also possible to inject a number of node IDs, which can be achieved by providing a comma-separated list of node IDs:

```jsx
MATCH (n:Person @ 1, 2, 3) return n.name
```

which will return the `name` property values for the nodes with IDs `1`, `2`, and `3`.

# üìÆ¬†Metaqueries

On top of supporting queries which return or alter information _in the graph_, TuringDB supports a number of _‚Äúmetaqueries‚Äù_ which return information, or metadata, _about the graph_.

These queries follow the `CALL` syntax, and the following variants are supported:

1. `CALL PROPERTIES ()` - returns a column of all the different node and edge properties and their types in the database
2. `CALL LABELS ()` - returns a column of all the different node labels
3. `CALL EDGETYPES()` - returns a column of all the different edge types (edge equivalent of node labels)
4. `CALL LABELSETS ()` - returns a two columns describing combinations of node labels

These metaqueries are useful for exploring the data which is available in the graph, and using this to plan `MATCH` queries.

# ü™õ¬†Commands

Outside of CYPHER, there are a number of commands which you can use to interact with the TuringDB engine.

| Command                     | Explanation                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `LOAD GRAPH <graph name>`   | Load the specified graph. Requires the graph files to be accessible to the TuringDB instance |
| `HISTORY`                   | Prints the history of the version control system                                             |
| `CHANGE NEW`                | Creates a new change, returning a column with the ID of the created change                   |
| `CHANGE SUBMIT`             | When checked out on a specific change, submits all changes made to the ‚Äúmaster branch‚Äù       |
| `CHANGE DELETE`             | Deletes the currently checked out change                                                     |
| `CHANGE LIST`               | Lists the currently active (uncommitted) changes                                             |
| `LIST GRAPH`                | Lists the available graphs                                                                   |

# üõ£Ô∏è¬†Roadmap

Whilst TuringDB currently supports a subset of CYPHER, by the next release, the support will be close to 100%. We also plan to support more features outside of CYPHER, which we already do with the string approximation operator, `~=`.
