# 🛠️ How to Execute Workflows

After successfully building the workflow, it’s now time to execute it:

1. ✅ **Import nodes and builder**
2. ✅ **Create the workflow builder**
3. ✅ **Define and add nodes**
4. ✅ **Connect the nodes**
5. ➡️ **Build and visualize the pipeline**
6. ➡️ **Execute the pipeline**
7. ⏱️ **Get outputs and results**


For both [✍️ Example 1](/build_workflows) and [📄 Example 2](/build_workflows) from Create Workflow section, here is how to execute workflows that have been built previously:

1. ➡️ **Build and visualize the pipeline**
    
    ```python
    # Build the pipeline
    pipeline = builder.build()
    ```
    
2. ➡️ **Execute the pipeline**
    
    ```python
    # Visualize the pipeline
    display(pipeline)  # or simply `pipeline` at the end of a notebook cell
    ```
