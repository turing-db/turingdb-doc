### üõ†Ô∏è How to Build Workflows

TuringDB lets you design and execute **analytical and agentic workflows** that combine:

- File processing
- LLM queries
- Graph analytics
- Graph memory via TuringDB

This guide shows how to use these workflows step by step using the `workflowcommon` Python SDK.


## üì¶ Installation

To get started, clone the `workflowcommon` repository and install it using `uv`:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/turingdb/workflowcommon.git>
cd workflowcommon
uv pip install -e .
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Usage Basics

We use the `FlowBuilder` class to define workflows using **nodes** and **connections**. Each node corresponds to a task (e.g., extract text, run an LLM, query TuringDB).

### üîÑ Steps to use a workflow:

1. **Import nodes and builder**
2. **Create the workflow builder**
3. **Define and add nodes**
4. **Connect the nodes**
5. **Build and visualize the pipeline**
6. **Execute the pipeline**
7. **Get outputs and results**
