Here you can find some exemples of analytical & agentic workflows that can be built & executed to analyse complex connected data with TuringDB

Codeblock showing one or two simple workflows

## Database Integration

Integrate a simple relational database to be transformed in a graph database structure to visualise, analyse, and reason on the graphs. 

Example with our partner antibody database from CiteAb (sample database): 

From table structure to graph 

## Automatic Queries from APIs

Here we define a list of stock tickers from the ARKK ETF to automatically query them from a finance data API (i.e., Polygon) to then be analysed as a correlation graph of the stocks and as a dependency graph of the companies in the ARKK ETF portfolio. 

## Multi-Documents to Graph

Here we take multiple clinical notes documents (for the exemple we are using synthetic data), to uncover relationships between treatments, markers, health events, sympotms, clinical outcomes of a patient across multiple encounters. 

## Document to Graph

Here we study the supply chain of Apple trying to see the interaction and dependencies on different countries & regions for different parts (e.g. batteries, screens, etc) of Apple products. The reference document used is a report from the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/apples-supply-chain-economic-and-geopolitical-implications/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Graph as Memory for Agents

Here we leverage a knowledge graph stored on TuringDB and queried via Text2Cypher to be used a kind of Graph Memory for an agentic workflow. CHECK WITH LUC
