After successfully executing the workflow, it’s now time to get the outputs and results:

1. ✅ **Import nodes and builder**
2. ✅ **Create the workflow builder**
3. ✅ **Define and add nodes**
4. ✅ **Connect the nodes**
5. ✅ **Build and visualize the pipeline**
6. ✅ **Execute the pipeline**
7. ➡️ **Get outputs and results**


For both [✍️ Example 1](/build_workflows) and [📄 Example 2](/build_workflows) from Create Workflow section, here is how to execute workflows that have been built previously:

1. ➡️ **Get outputs and results**

```python
# Execute pipeline and get resuls
results = pipeline.execute()

# Show results
display(results)  # or simply `results` at the end of a notebook cell
```

output:

```python
{
		'data':
				FlowData(...),
		'error': None,
		'node_results': {
				0: NodeResult(node_id=0, data=FlowData(...),
				1: NodeResult(node_id=1, data=FlowData(...),
				2: NodeResult(node_id=2, data=FlowData(...),
				...
		}            
}
```

## Explore results

- `results.data` : contains the state of `FlowData` object after the execution of the last node
- `results.node_results` : dictionary containing the states of `FlowData` object after the execution of each node of the workflow. Using this field, we can traceback the intermediate steps of the workflow
- `results.error` : if an error occurs during workflow execution, the error message will be saved in this field

## Remarks

- Workflow always goes to the end, even if an error occurs during the execution.
- If no error occurred during execution, `results.error` is `None`
- If an error occurred during execution, `results.error` contains the error message
