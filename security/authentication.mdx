# 🔐 Authentication

To access your **TuringDB Cloud instance**, authentication is required. TuringDB supports two simple authentication components:

1. **API Token** — Proves your identity
2. **Instance ID** — Identifies the specific graph database instance you're working with

Both are required when using the SDK or making API requests.


## 🔑 1. API Token

The **API token** is a secret key that authenticates you as a user. You can find and manage your tokens in the **Settings > API Keys** panel.

### 📋 How to find your API token:

**Step 1:** Click your avatar (bottom-left corner) → `Settings`

**Step 2:** Select the `API Keys` tab

You can:

- Click the 👁️ icon to reveal your token
- Click the 📋 icon to copy it to your clipboard

> ⚠️ Keep your API token secure — anyone with it can access your instance.

## 🧭 2. Instance ID

Each TuringDB instance has a unique **Instance ID**. This is used to route your requests to the correct graph engine.

### 📋 How to find your Instance ID:

- Go to the `Instances` page
- Locate your instance card
- Copy the **Instance ID** from the top-right corner

## 🧪 SDK Authentication

Once you've created an instance, you can interact with it through the Python SDK or API using:

- Your **API token**
- Your **Instance ID**

Both are passed to the SDK to authenticate and target your requests.

```python
client = TuringDBClient(
    instance_id="your-instance-id",
    api_token="your-api-token"
)
```

🛎️ Note: The authentication gateway refreshes every 60 seconds, so after creating a new instance or token, you may need to wait up to 1 minute for access to be available.
