    ```jsx
    // Create a node Person (Jane) - Edge (knows) - node Person (John)
    CREATE (:Person {name: 'Jane'})-[:KNOWS]->(:Person {name: 'John'})
    
    // Commit the changes
    COMMIT
    ```

    In the `CREATE` query above, the two nodes having label Person and the edge were created in the same query. You can also create nodes and queries one by one (less efficient).

    ```jsx
    // Create two nodes Person : Jane and John
    CREATE (:Person {name: 'John'})
    CREATE (:Person {name: 'Jane'})
    
    // You need to commit the changes after node creation
    COMMIT
    
    // Create edge of label KNOWS between Jane and John
    MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Jane'}), (m:Person {name: 'John'})
    CREATE (n)-[e:KNOWS]->(m)
    
    // Commit the changes
    COMMIT
    ```

    <Warning>
      In the case you create the nodes then the edges, you need to commit your changes after node creation.
