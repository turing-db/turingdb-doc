    ```python
    # client.set_graph("mygraph")  # set working graph is not already done
    client.checkout(my_change)
    
    # Create a node Person (Jane) - Edge (knows) - node (John)
    client.query("CREATE (n:Person {name: 'Jane'})-[e:KNOWS]->(m:Person {name: 'John'})")
    
    # Commit the change
    client.query("COMMIT")
    ```
  </Tab>

In the `CREATE` query above, the two nodes having label Person and the edge were created in the same query. You can also create nodes and queries one by one (less efficient).

```python
# client.set_graph("mygraph")  # set working graph is not already done
client.checkout(my_change)

# Create two nodes Person : Jane and John
client.query("CREATE (n:Person {name: 'John'})")
client.query("CREATE (n:Person {name: 'Jane'})")

# You need to commit the changes after node creation
client.query("COMMIT")

# Create edge of label KNOWS between Jane and John
client.query("MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Jane'}), (m:Person {name: 'John'}) CREATE (n)-[e:KNOWS]->(m)")

# Commit the change
client.query("COMMIT")
```
