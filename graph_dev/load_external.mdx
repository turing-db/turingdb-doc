description: "Load external data types into a TuringDB graph"
---

We provide different ways to load external data into a TuringDB graph. As for now, the following format can be imported to a TuringDB graph:

- `jsonl`
- `gml`

To be able to import external files into a TuringDB graph, they have to be saved into the `data` subdirectory in the TuringDB directory: `-turing-dir` flag when you run `turingdb` (by default is `$HOME/.turing`).

    Load a `jsonl` file as a TuringDB graph:

    ```jsx
    LOAD JSONL 'myjsonl.json' AS mygraph
    ```

    Load a `gml` file as a TuringDB graph:

    ```jsx
    LOAD GML 'mygml.gml' AS mygraph
    ```

    Load a jsonl file as a TuringDB graph:

    ```python

    Load a gml file as a TuringDB graph:

    ```python
