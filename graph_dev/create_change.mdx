    ```jsx
    // Create a new change on the graph
    change new
    
    // Checkout into the change
    checkout change-<ID>  // e.g. checkout change-0
    ```

    Each time you execute `change new`, a new change is created using the next integer available. This means if 3 changes have already been created (with IDs `0`, `1` and `2`), the next change will have the ID `3`. To checkout in this change, execute `checkout change-3`.

    Each time you execute `client.new_change()`, a new change is created using the next integer available. This means if 3 changes have already been created (with IDs `0`, `1` and `2`), the next change will have the ID `3`. To checkout in this change, execute `client.checkout(change=3)`.
