description: "Creating a change on a TuringDB graph is similar to creating a new branch on a git repository. It gives you access to an isolated writable environment that has no impact on other users."
---

<Warning>
  On this release version, avoid doing too many small commits on a graph and favorise bulk changes. It can lead to a loss in query performance after too many commits on a graph. This will be fixed in the next release.
