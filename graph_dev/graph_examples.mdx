    ```python
    from turingdb import TuringDB
    
    # Connect to your TuringDB instance
    client = TuringDB(
      instance_id="your-instance-id",
      auth_token="your-api-token"
    )
    
    # Set the graph you want to work with
    graph_name = "graph_name"
    client.set_graph(graph_name)
    
    # 1. Create a new change
    change_response = client.query("CHANGE NEW")
    
    # Extract the change ID (in hex format)
    change_id = change_response.iloc[0, 0]
    print(f"Created change ID: {change_id}")
    
    # 2. Checkout to the new change
    client.checkout(change=change_id)
    
    # 3. Submit a query to that change
    client.query('CREATE (n:Person {Name:"Jane"})-[e:knows]-(m:Person {Name:"John"})')
    
    # 4. Submit the change to the main graph
    client.query("CHANGE SUBMIT")
    
    # 5. Query the main branch to validate
    client.checkout("main")  # back to HEAD
    df = client.query('MATCH (n:Person {Name:"Jane"})-[e:knows]-(m:Person {Name:"John"}) RETURN n, e, m')
    print(df)
    ```
