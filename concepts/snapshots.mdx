# Snapshot Isolation in TuringDB

TuringDB is designed to support **ACID t**ransactions with **native snapshot isolation (SI)** as a **default, zero-cost feature**. This section explains:

- What snapshot isolation is
- Why it matters in graph databases
- How TuringDB achieves it differently from Neo4J or MemGraph
- And why it comes with **no performance tradeoff** in our architecture

## What Is Snapshot Isolation?

**Snapshot isolation (SI)** is a database property that guarantees:

> A transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database as it was at the start of the transaction.

### Key Guarantees

- You only see **committed data**
- You never see **uncommitted or intermediate states**
- You never see the **effects of future or concurrent transactions**
- Your transaction operates on a **stable, unchanging view** of the graph

_Definition adapted from the classic ACID transaction model_

(Gray & Reuter, 1993; Haerder & Reuter, 1983)

## TuringDB is Fully ACID-Compliant

TuringDB supports the full ACID model:

| Principle       | Meaning                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomicity**   | All-or-nothing: if a transaction fails, nothing is applied             |
| **Consistency** | Every transaction transforms the graph from one valid state to another |
| **Isolation**   | Each transaction operates as if it’s the only one                      |
| **Durability**  | Once committed, data survives crashes and restarts                     |

_Based on the definition of Jim Gray & Andreas Reuter_ ([Gray & Reuter, 1993](https://archive.org/details/transactionproce0000gray))

## Industry Comparisons: Neo4J and MemGraph

Most graph databases fall short of true snapshot isolation.

### Neo4J

- Default isolation level: **Read Committed**
- This means you **might observe changes from concurrent transactions**
- Neo4J allows **non-repeatable reads** unless you manually manage locks
- Full SI is **not enforced unless using explicit log-based transaction locking**

📎 [Neo4J docs](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/database-internals/)

> Risk: Unpredictable graph states in analytics or during parallel workflows.

### MemGraph

- Claims to be ACID-compliant
- Offers **multiple isolation levels**, but **not full snapshot isolation by default**
- Isolation behavior depends on how queries and write batches are structured

📎 [MemGraph blog: ACID & Isolation](https://memgraph.com/blog/acid-transactions-meaning-of-isolation-levels)

> Risk: Reads and writes may conflict without explicit coordination.

## TuringDB’s Approach to Snapshot Isolation

TuringDB provides **Snapshot Isolation by default**, and critically:

> It comes at zero performance cost.

Here’s how:

### Versioned Graphs by Design

Every graph in TuringDB is stored as a **sequence of immutable commits**, much like Git. Each commit is composed of **DataParts**, read-optimized storage chunks for nodes and edges.

- Each transaction runs against a **specific commit snapshot**

- That snapshot is **immutable and isolated**

- Reads do not block writes, and vice versa

- You can always “time travel” to past states by checking out any previous commit

> TuringDB doesn’t need to acquire write locks or maintain transaction logs for reads. SI is built-in, not bolted on.

## Why It Matters

| Feature                  | Without SI                      | With Snapshot Isolation (TuringDB)      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Concurrent analytics     | Risk of inconsistency           | Always safe and repeatable            |
| LLM or AI agent reads    | Can see in-progress updates     | Only sees committed graph states      |
| Live dashboards          | Glitches from concurrent writes | Never interrupted or corrupted        |
| Graph training workflows | Risk of nondeterminism          | Guaranteed reproducibility            |
| Rollbacks or audits      | Hard to trace                   | Time-travel enabled by commit history |

## Summary

TuringDB offers **built-in Snapshot Isolation** that is:

- Default
- Immutable
- Fast
- Lock-free
- Compatible with analytics and AI use cases
- Based on a Git-like architecture built for parallelism and consistency

> It’s the first graph database to natively combine versioning, immutability, and snapshot isolation, without the tradeoffs.
