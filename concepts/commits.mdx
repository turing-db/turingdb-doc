TuringDB is a graph database that stores connected data (nodes and relationships) with **built-in version control**. The system combines graph database capabilities with **time travel**, enabling isolated workspaces, full change tracking, and safe collaboration‚Äîwithout merge conflicts or stale state worries.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial data load"
  
    branch change-1
    branch change-2
    checkout change-1
    commit id: "Add new nodes"
    commit id: "Update relationships"
    checkout change-2
    commit id: "Test hypothesis A"
    commit id: "Refine analysis"
    checkout main
    merge change-1
    commit id: "Production update"
```

With version control, you can explore ideas in parallel, test "what-if" hypotheses, reproduce past states, and audit data evolution. It's like Git‚Äîbut for graph data.

## üß© Core Concepts

TuringDB's versioning scheme borrows familiar concepts from Git and Perforce:

Commit: A unit of change. Commits include new nodes/edges, updates, or deletions.

Main branch: Canonical history of all accepted and merged commits.

Change: An isolated "branch" of the graph where you can make commits without affecting main.

HEAD: The current tip of a Change or the main branch‚Äîi.e., the active snapshot of your graph.

With these primitives, you can:

Safely experiment in isolation

Audit the entire commit history

"Time travel" by checking out a past commit

Reproduce previous analyses and results

Roll back accidental or problematic changes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Guide
<Warning> The CLI version is unfortunately not available in the August 2025 release </Warning>

1. Create and switch to a new Change

```graphql
> change new "my-change"
> checkout "my-change"
```

This creates a new branch (change) called my-change and switches your workspace to it.

2. Modify the graph
   Make updates using Cypher-style queries:

```graphql
> CREATE ...
> SET ...
> commit
```

A change can contain any number of commits. Each commit captures the exact transformation applied to the graph.

3. Merge back to main
   Once you're happy with your updates:

```graphql
> change submit
> history
```

This submits your change to the main branch and merges all its commits. You can then inspect your updated graph history.

## üß™ Practical Example: Protein Interaction Study

üîç Load the Reactome knowledge graph

```graphql
> history

+-----------------------+
| Commit: 701edb        |
+-----------------------+
| Commit: be9643 (HEAD) |
|   - 2,588,826 nodes   |
|   - 10,042,846 edges  |
+-----------------------+
```

üîé Query original graph

```graphql
> MATCH (n { "displayName (String)": "APOE-4 [extracellular region]" })--(m)
  RETURN n,  m."displayName (String)"
   
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | extracellular region                    |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | Homo sapiens                            |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | UniProt:P02649 APOE                     |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | L-cysteine 112 replaced with L-arginine |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
```

‚ûï Add new data

```graphql
> CREATE (at 514785)
           -[e:HasWikipediaPage]
           -(m:WikipediaPage {
              "displayName (String)": "APOE-4 wiki",
              "url (String)": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"
            })
```

This adds a WikipediaPage node and connects it to APOE-4.

‚úÖ Submit the change

```graphql
> change submit
> history

+-----------------------+
| Commit: 701edb        |
+-----------------------+
| Commit: be9643        |
|   - 2,588,826 nodes   |
|   - 10,042,846 edges  |
+-----------------------+
| Commit: 35fcd8 (HEAD) |
|   - 1 nodes           |
|   - 1 edges           |
+-----------------------+
```

The current state of the graph's history can be represented by the following diagram.

üå≥ Updated graph history

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id:"(701edb) Initial"
    commit id:"(be9643) Reactome"
    branch "apoe4-update"
    checkout "apoe4-update"
    commit id: "(35fcd8) APOE-4 wiki page"
    checkout main
    merge "apoe4-update"
```

Now everyone sees the APOE-4 wiki connection as part of the main graph.

```graphql
> MATCH (n { "displayName (String)": "APOE-4 [extracellular region]" })--(m)
  RETURN n,  m."displayName (String)"
   
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | **APOE-4 wiki**                             |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | extracellular region                    |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | Homo sapiens                            |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | UniProt:P02649 APOE                     |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | L-cysteine 112 replaced with L-arginine |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
```

‚è™ Time Travel
Need to reproduce a past result? Just check out a previous commit:

```graphql
> checkout be9643
> MATCH (n { "displayName (String)": "APOE-4 [extracellular region]" })--(m)
  RETURN n,  m."displayName (String)"
   
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | New APOE-4 neighbour                    |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | extracellular region                    |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | Homo sapiens                            |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
| 514785 | UniProt:P02649 APOE                     |
+--------+-----------------------------------------+
```

Poof‚Äîback in time. The Wikipedia node vanishes because it didn't exist yet in this snapshot.
