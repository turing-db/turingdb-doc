**TuringDB has eliminated the plague of read locks.**  
Our architecture is designed from the ground up to deliver **true snapshot isolation**—without sacrificing performance or scalability.


## 🚫 The Problem with Traditional Databases

In most RDBMS systems, **read queries are blocked by write operations**. This means:

- Analytics pipelines stall during ingestion
- Dashboards freeze under concurrent load
- AI workloads suffer from stale or delayed data access

This is a dealbreaker for real-time systems.


## ✅ TuringDB’s Zero-Lock Architecture

TuringDB rewrites the rules.

- Every **read transaction executes on its own immutable snapshot** of the graph.
- **Writes never block reads**, and reads never interfere with writes.
- **Snapshot Isolation is enabled by default**, with **no coordination cost**.
- Built-in support for **massive parallelism**, powering:
  - Real-time dashboards
  - AI pipelines
  - Batch analytics

📈 **Analytics stay fast, live, and responsive—always.**

## 🔍 How It Works

When a write query modifies the database, it creates a new **snapshot** behind the scenes. Read queries simply operate on whichever snapshot they start from—no locks, no contention.

This ensures:

- **Consistent reads** at a fixed point in time
- **Concurrent write throughput** without coordination bottlenecks
- **Scalable multi-user workloads**
