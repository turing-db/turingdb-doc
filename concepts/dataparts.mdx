## Intelligent DataPart Merging

We have developed policies and algorithms to **intelligently merge DataParts** in the background. The goal is to:

- Automatically compact multiple DataParts into fewer ones
- Detect hot paths and frequently accessed subgraphs
- Optimize for query throughput and storage locality

Commits **start as multiple data parts for fast ingestion** and **converge toward compact forms** for analytical speed, combining the best of both worlds.

## Summary

| Feature                       | Benefit                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Immutable DataParts           | Safe versioning and reuse              |
| Parallel write ingestion      | High-performance batch processing      |
| Shared storage across commits | Lower memory usage, fast snapshots     |
| Merge roadmap                 | Compact layout for ultimate read speed |

TuringDB uses **DataParts** to balance **high-speed writes**, **versioned safety**, and **read-optimized performance**, all in a single, cohesive engine.
