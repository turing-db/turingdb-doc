**TuringDB** is a blazing-fast, in-memory graph database engine purpose-built for **analytics and AI**. It’s not just fast, it’s *ridiculously fast* (for a graph database). We're talking **sub-millisecond queries** on graphs with **10M+ nodes and edges**, no index tuning, and no performance drama.

TuringDB is the graph engine built to feel like magic.

## 🚀 Our Philosophy: Built for the Complexity
We want to make the world computable, by connecting everything, in real time. 
From molecules to markets, data to wisdom, we build the graph that makes it visible, traversable, and alive.

We created TuringDB because the world runs on connected data, and old-school databases just can’t keep up.

We believe:

- ⚡ **Analytics shouldn’t wait**  
  Modern applications cannot wait minutes to get an answer to a complex query!

- ⏳ **Versioning should be native**  
  Every change is an immutable commit—like Git for your graphs.

- 🔓 **No more locking drama**  
  Zero-lock concurrency means reads and writes don't bother each other, even at scale.

- 🖼️ **Graphs should scale *and* sparkle**  
  Visualize big graphs in real-time with our built-in OpenGL explorer.

- 🧠 **AI needs memory**  
  We power GraphRAG and versioned agent graph memory with full auditability.

We built TuringDB for the real-world problems we faced as data scientists and software engineers. You shouldn’t need to choose between speed, usability, and insights.

## 🧠 Why Teams Choose TuringDB

- **Data Scientists** love the exploratory power—multi-hop reasoning with real-time feedback.
- **AI Engineers** build grounded LLMs and agents with time-aware graph memory.
- **Bioinformaticians** model billions of interactions across proteins, genes, cells, and get results in minutes, not days.
- **Quants** analyse complex dependencies in your portfolios and find your alpha by managing the complexity of financial markets.
- **Fraud Analysts** detect fraud rings and anomalies by traversing transaction graphs in real time.
- **Manufacturing & Supply Chain Analysts** simulate "what-if" changes on live dependency graphs with confidence.

If your data is connected and your decisions are complex, TuringDB may be just for you.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

| Feature                        | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| **In-Memory Column Store**    | Combines columnar efficiency with graph traversal speed. |
| **Sub-ms Query Latency**      | Deep multi-hop queries in 1–50ms. |
| **Zero-Lock Concurrency**     | Reads never block writes. Writes never block reads. |
| **Git-Like Versioning**       | Commit, branch, merge, and time-travel your data. |
| **Built-in Visualization**    | Explore your big graphs, the best, the biggest graphs in your browser. |
| **Elastic Cloud Scaling**     | Spin up, scale out, or scale to zero—no servers to manage. |
