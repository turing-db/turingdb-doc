**TuringDB** is a blazing-fast, in-memory graph database engine purpose-built for **analytics and AI**. It’s not just fast, it’s _ridiculously fast_ (for a graph database). We're talking **sub-millisecond queries** on graphs with **10M+ nodes and edges**, no index tuning, and just fast out of the box.

TuringDB is the graph engine built to feel like magic.

## Our Philosophy: Built for the Complexity

We want to make the world computable, by connecting everything, in real time. From molecules to markets, we build the graph that makes it visible, traversable, and alive.

We created TuringDB because the world runs on connected data.

We believe:

- **Analytics shouldn’t wait**\
  Modern applications cannot wait minutes to get an answer to a complex query!
- **Versioning should be native**\
  Every change is an immutable commit—like Git for your graphs.
- **No more locking**\
  Zero-lock concurrency means reads and writes don't bother each other, even at scale.
- **_Graphs should scale and sparkle_**\
  Visualize big graphs in real-time with our built-in OpenGL explorer.
- **AI needs memory**\
  We power GraphRAG and versioned agent graph memory with full auditability.

We built TuringDB for the real-world problems we faced as data scientists and software engineers. You shouldn’t need to choose between speed, usability, and insights.

## Why Teams Choose TuringDB

- **Data Scientists** love the exploratory power—multi-hop reasoning with real-time feedback.
- **AI Engineers** build grounded LLMs and agents with time-aware graph memory.
- **Bioinformaticians** model billions of interactions across proteins, genes, cells, and get results in minutes, not days.
- **Quants** analyse complex dependencies in your portfolios and find your alpha by managing the complexity of financial markets.
- **Fraud Analysts** detect fraud rings and anomalies by traversing transaction graphs in real time.
- **Manufacturing & Supply Chain Analysts** simulate "what-if" changes on live dependency graphs with confidence.

If your data is connected and your decisions are complex, TuringDB may be just for you.
